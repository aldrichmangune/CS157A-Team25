Project Overview
In this project, we will be working on a three-tier database application for SJSU students to sell or buy their used textbooks. 
We will be developing a database for an e-commerce site for online textbook shopping service. A popular way for students to save money 
on course materials is to purchase used textbooks. The goal is to provide a common interactive platform for students to buy new/used 
textbooks or listing their used textbooks for sale. In addition, we would also like to offer another alternative for SJSU students 
that want to reliably sell and buy used textbooks. In this application, there will be 2 majorities of users will be using this 
application which is the buyer and the seller of the used textbooks. The seller can sell their used textbook at any price as they wish. 
An e-commerce website will provide ease of access to our products/services and satisfy the demands of our customers in a timely manner.


System Environment


(Missing Diagram Here that will be display on our Google Docs Link)


Our client interface(front-end) will be built using JavaScript, CSS/HTML5. The web server will be set up with Apache as our platform and 
our server-side language being PHP while our scripting language choice is Python. Our database will naturally utilize MySQL.

Non-functional Issues

4.1 Overview of User Interface
UI is designed according to the user-friendly interface principle. The UI is designed in such a way of related things are combined 
together and unrelated things are placed in the drawer layout UI. For instance, the user wants to buy a textbook and they will press the
buyer button on the homepage in order to be directed to a search bar. Subsequently, the user will be able to input information about the
textbook into the search, consequently, the results of the textbook that matches the search keyword will be listed on a scroll view 
depends on the searches result from our database. Our application design is straightforward and providing direct access to common 
functions. In addition, we also design the interface as simple as possible so that most of the users do not need much explanation 
on how to use this application. The goal of this application is to provide good user experience by designing a clean, simple and 
intuitive interface.

4.2 Security and access control
The user will first be prompted to log into their account before being able to access any of the other activities. 
If the user does not have an account, the user will select the Register button in order to register an account. When the user logs 
into their account, they will be sent to the home page. There will be 3 main functions in the home page which are sell, buy and 
transaction. When the user selects the buy button on the home page, they will be navigated to the search activity page in order 
to search for a textbook. The search function will put up different textbooks depending on the user input and the user will be able
to view the profile of the seller of the listed textbook by selecting the profile button. The user will also be able to bookmark 
listed textbooks with the bookmark button to view later.
